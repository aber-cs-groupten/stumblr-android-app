It's Bernie Beer!! (Named after our customer)

Designed and drew a logo/mascot for our app, it's recieved generally positive feedback :)

Yes I drew him in paint.

Also I put the image through an app icon generator, and screen-shotted it. Thats here too.

An improvement could be made to the hand etc, he's supposed to be holding a beer.

Yes, a beer drinking a beer. Dont overthink it.

Improve if you will, keep in mind that it needs to keep its doodle-esque design charm though.

Its saved as a PNG file, if you need it in another format let me know.

Awesome.

Kenny :)
